one (`Rat.distToNearestInt`) — the bridge between the two `NearestInt` files. -/

/-- A point of `[0, 1]` is at distance at least `min y (1 - y)` from `ℤ`; together with
`distToNearestInt_le_abs_sub_intCast` this pins `distToNearestInt` on a fundamental domain.
(Outside `[0, 1]` the bound is vacuous, so no hypothesis is needed.) -/

/-- If `x` sits in the middle part `[k + δ, k + 1 - δ]` of the gap between two consecutive
integers, then it is at distance at least `δ` from `ℤ`.  This is the workhorse behind the
"trap" conditions of Pollington's construction. -/
